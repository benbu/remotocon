remotocon
=========

Control your computer from anywhere using your phone.

remotocon is an android app that allows developers to create android plugins that communicate with computer plugins written in C#.

An example plugin is provided for browsing files on your computer. Copy that or modify it to create new plugins since there is no scaffolding system or other documentation for creating plugins at this point.

I worked on this project a few years ago, and then it sat on the back burner for a long time, so now it's here.

There is no documentation, but the app is pretty small with little dependencies.
